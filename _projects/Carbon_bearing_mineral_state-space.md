We wish to map the variable-space of CO2 bearing mineral phases (calcite, aragonite, siderite, etc.) 
as it relates to variation in all major element abundances, temperature, pressure, pH, and fO2 of aqueous 
environments common to the Earthâ€™s surface.

Conventional environmental chemistry approaches in aqueous environments consider the precipitation of 
mineral phases if their stability fields are intersected by a given fluid system being modeled as it is 
driven to change in T, P, fO2 etc. via measures such as affinity or Gibbs free energy. We wish to take 
a reverse approach, beginning instead with an aqueous system that clearly falls within the stability 
field of a given carbon bearing mineral, before changing every thermodynamic aspect that is contained 
within, moving about this state-space in small steps, defining the full n-dimensional stability field of the given mineral. 


Once this state-space has been filled (and it will be computationally dense as it is of a very high dimension, 
with each element and thermodynamic state variable providing a dimension), locales on Earth (lakes, rivers, 
streams, derived fluids in industry, mining, manufacturing etc.) that overlap with this space or fall near 
to it can be pondered, effectively painting these environments back onto the carbon-bearing minerals. 

There is a lot to be be learned from the shape of this state space and the distance and direction to any 
given environmental sample, as environments which are close to but not overlapping with it might be easily 
altered such that they precipitate a given carbon phase. In this way a list of previously unrealized carbon 
sinks might be discovered.
