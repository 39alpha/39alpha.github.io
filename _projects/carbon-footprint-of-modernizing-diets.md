# Laymen
What is the carbon footprint of modernizing diets? It takes 10 pounds of grain to generate 1 pound of beef. How do methane fluxes change as a result? In which regions of the world are they increasingly pumping into the atmosphere, and what are the knock on effects of this?

I known this is a phenomenon in China, where large demographic shifts are motivating dietary shifts.

Other impacts: water use, land use,
