# Laymen
Imagine sitting in bar in the early afternoon at a table full of your coworkers. The place is relatively empty and you are 
speaking easily with everyone at the table, including that attractive girl from accounting sitting a couple places down 
across the table. Mary, you think her name is. Eventually, happy hour begins. The bar turns the music up and the crowds 
begin filing in. 30 minutes later you are talking loudly to the people sitting immediately next to you, Bob 
(also from accounting) and Jared from customer support. You wanted to keep talking to the whole table, so as to include 
Mary from accounting, but your environment changed. The noise has increased such that, even if you obnoxiously shouted, 
she wouldn’t make out the message in your words (and you’d look like an idiot). You really wanted to get to know her, 
but there is no chance of that now. Only Todd will get that opportunity, as he managed to snag the seat next to her when 
you all sat down.

# Science
Many whale species, such as sperm whales, blue whales, and humpback whales, depend on long range communication. 
Species such as sperm whales can have regional dialects in their complex system of calls and clicks which facilitates 
a culture of unknown complexity. The industrial revolution, followed by modern warfare has ushered in a new regime of 
sound production in the seas, across the bandwidth spectrum. Some regions of the spectrum that may have previously been quite, 
may now be very loud, including regions employed by these species for long range communication. Is it possible that such 
noise pollution might cause speciation by segregating previously overlapping populations into dialect groups?  
If so. Do whale population shave the numbers to support such a segregation? Can you even cause speciation via language? 
I think the answer is maybe. Whales often find mates by answering calls over very large distances. If they stop recognizing 
calls from their own species (due to different dialect), then maybe they stop answering them). 
If such noise pollution causes dialect schisms? and if these result in speciation. Just how small would the resulting 
population shave to be to become susceptible to extinction via environmental change, bottelneck effects, and overfishing? 

If such stocks are collapsed, then what are the effects down the food web?
