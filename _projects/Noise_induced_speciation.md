Imagine sitting in bar in the early afternoon at a table full of your coworkers. The place is relatively empty and you are 
speaking easily with everyone at the table, including that attractive woman from accounting sitting a couple places down 
across the table, Mary. Eventually, happy hour begins. The bar turns the music up and the crowds 
begin filing in. 30 minutes later you are talking loudly to the people sitting immediately next to you, Bob 
(also from accounting) and Jared from customer support. You wanted to keep talking to the whole table, so as to include 
Mary from accounting, but your environment changed. The noise has increased such that, even if you obnoxiously shouted, 
she wouldn’t make out the message in your words (and you’d look like an idiot). You really wanted to get to know her, 
but there is no chance of that now. Only Todd will get that opportunity, as he managed to snag the seat next to her when 
you all sat down.

Many whale species depend on long range vocal communication for locating conspecifics and especially mates, including both mysticetes (baleen whales) and odontocetes (toothed whales).
The industrial revolution, followed by increasing in shipping, recreational vehicles, and advances in modern undersea warfare, has ushered in a new era of sound production in the seas across a range of frequencies which include those used by whales<sup>1</sup> 1(https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00606/full). 

If regions of the sound spectrum used by whales which had been relatively quite during their language evolution have become noisy, then the distance with which they can send and receive information has likely gone down, as the signal to noise ratio has decreased. This may decrease the distance to which young males can effectively signal in the search for females.

This project focuses on exploring the possibility that such noise pollution might cause regional speciation via the segregating of previously overlapping populations, which would then be more susceptible to the genetic instabilities associated with smaller reproductive groups.


Do whale populations have the numbers to support such speciation? 

Can such noise pollution causes dialect schisms, even among populations that are otherwise overlapping at least part of the year? Can dialect schisms cause speciation?

How small do reproductive pools of different whale species need to become before the genetic instabilities result in likely extinction. 

How small would resulting populations have to be in order to become susceptible to extinction via environmental change, bottelneck effects,overfishing, etc.

If such stocks are collapsed, what are the effects down the food web?
