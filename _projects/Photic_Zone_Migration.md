# Laymen
A great deal of life in the oceans relies directly on both sunlight as a energy source, and on the seafloor itself to live on. This includes the vast majority if coral species. 

Corals are important because they act as a physical structures for other species to live among, like trees in a forest, and because the consume CO2 and release O2.


Light from the sun can only penetrate so far into seawater, meaning that corals rooted to the seafloor can only live in relatively shallow water. As sea levels rise, much of the seafloor that us currently lite up by sunlight during the day, may become to deep for enough light to penetrate.

We are interested in how the distribution of seafloor which coral can live on, will change as sea levels rise.

# Science

As ice sheets and glaciers melt and sea levels rise, how does the change in the location of the photic zone---the region below the sea surface where light penetrates with an efficacy capable of sustaining life--- relative to shallow seafloor change? The idea here, is that sessile creatures such as corals rooted at the seafloor in seas shallow enough for the seafloor to remained bathed in daylight, may have some of their environments extinguished by the diminishing light that comes with increased depth.

I think this is worth doing preliminary research on, however the obvious answer is that communities simply migrate to shallower regions. However, their may be costs associated with this movement, especially if the change in sea level is abrupt. Also, there may be physical barriers and/or chemical obstacles, such as coincident ocean acidification, which may stunt community migration.

There must be historic occurrences of this in various geochemical records, as sea levels have migrated over a few hundred of feet many times throughout Earths history. More recently in Earths history, this happened as the great ice sheets covering north America released the fresh water seas formed on their surfaces into the global ocean in at least 2 abrupt events.

In might also be worth investigating how changes in the raw area of shallow seafloor effects biodiversity and community structure. There have been times throughout Earth history where shallow seas, maybe even shallow enough to facilitate large examples of seafloor within the photic zone, have existed. For example, at times be sea levels where low enough to expose large portions of continental shelf to the photic zone.
