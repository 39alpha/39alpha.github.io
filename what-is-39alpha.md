# Who we are:
39Alpha is a nonprofit independent scientific research organization envisioned and founded by doctors of physics, information science, and geochemistry.


# What we are doing:
We are conducting original research on topics related to our scinetific mission: [To explore and quantify human interactions with the Earth](Science-Mission). We carry out this research under the direction of guiding principles which which represent paradigm shifts in _how_ open source research is conducted. This 39Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific orthodoxy in six differentiating ways (in more detail [here](6Differentiators)):

1. We operate and publish as teams. There are no individual authors.  
2. Our researchers do not hustle their own research grants. Their job is to do research.
3. We publish our tools, integrated within and alongside our scientific publications.
4. We publish our failures as such.
5. Our teams engage on one large-scale highly innovative and unconventional project at a time.
6. 39Alpha maintains an in-house social-psychology unit dedicated to evolving the method by which our teams interact, operate, and measure achivement.

# Why we are doing it:
We believe that there is inherent value in quantifying our biological, chemical, and integrated place on Earth, and we believe the modern scientific practices can be evolved to be more creative, more efficient, and more consequential.
