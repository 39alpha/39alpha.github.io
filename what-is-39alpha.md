# Who we are:
39Alpha has been conceived and founded by young researchers (doctors of physics and chemical thermodynamics) with an interest in doing research on their own terms, each uninspired by their own job prospects. Nearly all routes in open-source research remain within universities, where careers develop out of research and into management within 5 years of receiving a PhD. For bright minds interested in exploring the world as practitioners of science, uninterested in climbing scientific (university) social/management ladders, there are no real options. We seek to engage in meaningful research, solving problems of significance to humanity, giving it all away as we go, alongside the tools that we develop to solve those problems.

# What we are doing:
We at 39Alpha have developed a new formula for conducting original research. We are inspired by solutions in industry and other creative fields outside of science, guided by common sense, and motivated to overcome many established yet inefficient scientific practices moored by historical inertia. The 39Alpha method stands apart from modern scientific orthodoxy in six differentiating ways (in more detail here):

1. We operate and publish as teams. There are no individual authors.  
2. Our researchers do not hustle their own research grants. Their job is to do research.
3. We publish our tools, integrated within and alongside our scientific publications.
4. We publish our failures as such.
5. Our teams engage on one large-scale highly innovative and unconventional project at a time.
6 39Alpha maintains an in-house social-psychology unit dedicated to evolving the method by which our teams interact, operate, and measure achivement.

# Why we are doing it:
At 39Alpha, we believe that there is a better way to practice open-source science. We believe that the extant funding opportunities and the university structure that typically secures them motivates inefficiencies, hampers creativity and execution, and saps inspiration. We also believe that pure research benefiting humanity should be undertaking beyond proprietary control, instead of being siloed away within a company. We have begun to develop a living list of these problems and interests. 39Alpha research teams will actively engage in self-directed research on issues central to the topics listed here.
